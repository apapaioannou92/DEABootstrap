This is my undergraduate thesis/final project to earn Bachelor degree in Economics. My research is about determinant of technical efficiency crude palm oil industry in Indonesia using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Bootstrap and Tobit Estimation.
There are two step for analysing determinants of variables in this study. First, we obtain technical efficiency scores of decision making unit (DMU) of crude palm oil industries using Data Envelopment Analysis which require R programming language and 'Benchmark' package.
Second, we use those scores as dependent variables for Tobit Regression to know which independent variables have the significant contributions to technical efficiency scores.
