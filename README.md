# Data Envelopment Analysis Bootstrap with R
This is my undergraduate thesis/final project to earn Bachelor degree in Economics. My research is about technical efficiency determinant of crude palm oil industry in Indonesia using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) Bootstrap and Tobit Estimation.

There are two steps for analysing determinants of variables in this study. First, we obtain technical efficiency scores of decision making unit (DMU) of crude palm oil industries using Data Envelopment Analysis which require __R__ programming language and _Benchmarking_ package.
Second, we use those scores as dependent variables for Tobit Regression to know which independent variables have the significant contributions to technical efficiency scores.

In this repository, I will only post DEA Bootstrap source code in R. For the Tobit Estimation, I'm using STATA as requested by my thesis supervisor. If you are interested for my Tobit's *__.do__* file for this project, e-mail me at elissyah.nur.medina-2015@feb.unair.ac.id.
